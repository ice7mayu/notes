# Add any build step in post build action

There is a plugin that allows to make an `HTTP request` (GET and POST) as a build step.

There is also a plugin that allows `any build step` to be used in post-build actions.

To be able to use any build step as a post-build action, you need to enable this in the settings.

Go to: **Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System →** Flexible Push and switch the dropdown menu to "Any build step".
