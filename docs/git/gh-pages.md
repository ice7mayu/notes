# Publish site on gh-pages branch

Checkout `master` branch and create an orphan `gh-pages` branch with no parent commit histories.

```bash
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
```

Remove unnecessary files to start as a clean working directory.

```bash
git rm . -rf
```

Add only static files generated by SSG to working directory root. Commit and push to remote.

```bash
git add <static-site-files-only>
git push -u origin gh-pages
```

Select `gh-pages branch` as pages source from GitHub settings of current repository. Wait till it's finished and visit `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` to browse your site.
