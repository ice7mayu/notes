## primitive and reference

In JavaScript, a variable may store two types of values: primitive and reference.
JavaScript provides six primitive types as undefined, null, boolean, number, string, and symbol , and a reference type object.

If the value is a primitive value, when you access the variable, you manipulate the actual value stored in that variable. In other words, the variable that stores a primitive value is accessed by value.

Unlike a primitive value, when you manipulate an object, you work on the reference of that object, rather than the actual object. It means a variable that stores an object is accessed by reference.
