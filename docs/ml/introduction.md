## What is Machine Learning

> Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the > > form of observations and real-world interactions.

Machine Learning is a system that can learn from example through self-improvement and without being explicitly coded by programmer. The breakthrough comes with the idea that a machine can singularly learn from the data (i.e., example) to produce accurate results.

Machine learning combines data with statistical tools to predict an output. This output is then used by corporate to makes actionable insights. Machine learning is closely related to data mining and Bayesian predictive modeling. The machine receives data as input, use an algorithm to formulate answers.

A typical machine learning tasks are to provide a recommendation. For those who have a Netflix account, all recommendations of movies or series are based on the user's historical data. Tech companies are using unsupervised learning to improve the user experience with personalizing recommendation.

Machine learning is also used for a variety of task like fraud detection, predictive maintenance, portfolio optimization, automatize task and so on.

At its core, machine learning is a pattern recognition technology. So naturally, it’s excellent at finding patterns in data. It can then use those patterns identified by your machine learning algorithms to predict future trends. Of course, to do this, you need a set of data that would be impossible for a person to go through and detect all of the familiar repetitions. That’s why machine learning is so powerful.

There are many different types of machine learning algorithms, with hundreds published each day, and they’re typically grouped by either **learning style** (i.e. supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning) or by **similarity in form or function** (i.e. classification, regression, decision tree, clustering, deep learning, etc.).

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

### Supervised learning

An algorithm uses training data and feedback from humans to learn the relationship of given inputs to a given output. For instance, a practitioner can use marketing expense and weather forecast as input data to predict the sales of cans. You can use supervised learning when the output data is known. The algorithm will predict new data. There are two categories of supervised learning:

- Classification task
- Regression task

### Unsupervised learning

In unsupervised learning, an algorithm explores input data without being given an explicit output variable (e.g., explores customer demographic data to identify patterns). You can use it when you do not know how to classify the data, and you want the algorithm to find patterns and classify the data for you

## What is Deep Learning

Deep learning is a computer software that mimics the network of neurons in a brain. It is a subset of machine learning and is called deep learning because it makes use of deep neural networks. Deep learning algorithms are constructed with connected layers.

- The first layer is called the Input Layer
- The last layer is called the Output Layer
- All layers in between are called Hidden Layers. The word deep means the network join neurons in more than two layers.

Each Hidden layer is composed of neurons. The neurons are connected to each other. The neuron will process and then propagate the input signal it receives the layer above it. The strength of the signal given the neuron in the next layer depends on the weight, bias and activation function.

The network consumes large amounts of input data and operates them through multiple layers; the network can learn increasingly complex features of the data at each layer.

### Limitations of deep learning

#### Data labeling

Most current AI models are trained through "supervised learning." It means that humans must label and categorize the underlying data, which can be a sizable and error-prone chore. For example, companies developing self-driving-car technologies are hiring hundreds of people to manually annotate hours of video feeds from prototype vehicles to help train these systems.

#### Obtain huge training data sets

It has been shown that simple deep learning techniques like CNN can, in some cases, imitate the knowledge of experts in medicine and other fields. The current wave of machine learning, however, requires training data sets that are not only labeled but also sufficiently broad and universal.

Deep-learning methods required thousands of observation for models to become relatively good at classification tasks and, in some cases, millions for them to perform at the level of humans. Without surprise, deep learning is famous in giant tech companies; they are using big data to accumulate petabytes of data. It allows them to create an impressive and highly accurate deep learning model.

#### Explain a problem

Large and complex models can be hard to explain, in human terms. For instance, why a particular decision was obtained. It is one reason that acceptance of some AI tools are slow in application areas where interpretability is useful or indeed required.

Furthermore, as the application of AI expands, regulatory requirements could also drive the need for more explainable AI models.

### Summary

Deep learning is the new state-of-the-art for artificial intelligence. Deep learning architecture is composed of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The word deep means there are more than two fully connected layers.

There is a vast amount of neural network, where each architecture is designed to perform a given task. For instance, CNN works very well with pictures, RNN provides impressive results with time series and text analysis.

Deep learning is now active in different fields, from finance to marketing, supply chain, and marketing. Big firms are the first one to use deep learning because they have already a large pool of data. Deep learning requires to have an extensive training data set.
